# Welcome to our solar system

This project was made with THREE.js and GSAP. I got all the beautiful models from Sketchfab and will link them down below.

This project idea has been in my mind for a while now. It's definitely not original, many people have made something like this before me, but I had a lot of fun.

## Run this yourself

To run this project on your own local machine, all you have to do is clone the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies and after that `npm run dev` to run this project in your browser.

## Random lore

This project idea has been in my mind for a while now. It's definitely not original, many people have made something like this before me, but as someone interested in astronomy, THREE.js and GSAP, this seemed like a lot of fun to make!

A bit of a 'funny' backstory, before I made this, I started working on a portfolio. I wanted this portfolio to have a _really_ cool centerpiece. Then I thought, what's cooler to have than Gargantua, the supermassive black hole (cue one of the best
[Muse](https://open.spotify.com/track/3lPr8ghNDBLc2uZovNyLs9?si=22691e153d174025) songs out there) from Interstellar (which is my favorite movie by my favorite movie director) on your portfolio? And what's cooler than making it yourself?
So I started following this amazing [tutorial](https://youtu.be/XWv1Ajc3tfU?si=CRpPZEGEZLQnMz1B) to create my own Blender model to use. When I finished this really awesome model, I tried to upload it to the Three.js editor so I could export
it as a GLTF file and use it on my website. Turns out, there's a lot of Nodes in Blender which are NOT AT ALL compatible with Three.js. So I had put my blood, sweat and tears into following this tutorial, starting over a grand total of
4 times and even installing an older version so I could use a specific removed node, only to find out I couldn't even use it. OMG! That's when I decided to abort my portfolio mission for a bit, and start on this little project.
Our very own solar system where you could zoom in, out and read a few facts about these awesome astronomical objects.

## Challenges

To challenge myself even more, I decided I wanted to work with JavaScript classes, modules and also JSON data, where I stored the camera position and also the spots where the camera should look at. I enlisted the help of my [amazing boyfriend](https://github.com/kevvie303),
who is a skilled back-end developer and helped me make my JavaScript game a lot better and also more readable. I'd say he's a better help than ChatGPT or Github Copilot, but maybe I'm a little biased.
