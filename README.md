# Welcome to our solar system

This project was made with THREE.js and GSAP. I got all the beautiful models from Sketchfab and will link them down below.

This project idea has been in my mind for a while now. It's definitely not original, many people have made something like this before me, but I had a lot of fun. It's also not scientifically accurate, you can read more about that down below.

## Run this yourself

To run this project on your own local machine, all you have to do is clone the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies and after that `npm run dev` to run this project in your browser.

## Random lore

This project idea has been in my mind for a while now. It's definitely not original, many people have made something like this before me, but as someone interested in astronomy, THREE.js and GSAP, this seemed like a lot of fun to make!

A bit of a 'funny' backstory, before I made this, I started working on a portfolio. I wanted this portfolio to have a _really_ cool centerpiece. Then I thought, what's cooler to have than Gargantua, the supermassive black hole (cue one of the best
[Muse](https://open.spotify.com/track/3lPr8ghNDBLc2uZovNyLs9?si=22691e153d174025) songs out there) from Interstellar (which is my favorite movie by my favorite movie director) on your portfolio? And what's cooler than making it yourself?
So I started following this amazing [tutorial](https://youtu.be/XWv1Ajc3tfU?si=CRpPZEGEZLQnMz1B) to create my own Blender model to use. When I finished this really awesome model, I tried to upload it to the Three.js editor so I could export
it as a GLTF file and use it on my website. Turns out, there's a lot of Nodes in Blender which are NOT AT ALL compatible with Three.js. So I had put my blood, sweat and tears into following this tutorial, starting over a grand total of
4 times and even installing an older version so I could use a specific removed node, only to find out I couldn't even use it. OMG! That's when I decided to abort my portfolio mission for a bit, and start on this little project.
Our very own solar system where you could zoom in, out and read a few facts about these awesome astronomical objects.

## Challenges

To challenge myself even more, I decided I wanted to work with JavaScript classes, modules and also JSON data, where I stored the camera position and also the spots where the camera should look at. I enlisted the help of my [amazing boyfriend](https://github.com/kevvie303),
who is a skilled back-end developer and helped me make my JavaScript game a lot better and also more readable. I'd say he's a better help than ChatGPT or Github Copilot, but maybe I'm a little biased.

This is my first project working with Three.js and GSAP, and it's definitely not perfect. But this project was more about growth than perfection for me. Performance wise it can be a little bit laggy and it's not very pretty on small or really big screens. I used different camera positions so the models wouldn't get cut off on smaller laptops, but I have found it's quite difficult to make the planets look the same when in focus, since they're all different 3D models and I scaled them up/down depending on the model size.

## Disclaimers

This website is not scientifically accurate. The scale of the planets, sun and distance aren't correct and neither are their axial tilt, rotation speed and direction.

ScrollTrigger also turned out to be a big challenge, which is why the information cards aren't perfectly centered. As a perfectionist this is very annoying, but I decided to let this go for now, for the sake of my sanity.
