                <h2>The Sun</h2>
                <p>
                  Our sun is a yellow dwarf star. The glow emanating from it comes from nuclear fusion,
                  which causes a huge amount of energy to be created inside the sun‚Äôs core.
                  In about five billion years the sun will run out of fuel and stop shining.

                <p>
                  Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
                  Temperatures can vary from up to 430 degrees Celcius at daytime to -180 degrees at nighttime, because Mercury has no atmosphere.

                <p>
                  Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere and is the hottest planet in our solar system.
                  Among others, its size and structure is similar to earths,
                  which is why Venus has been referred to as earths twin.

                  Our home and the only place that is known to be inhabitated by living things.
                  Most of our planet is covered in water and its oceans were the place where life began,
                  aproximately 3,8 billion years ago.

                <h2>Mars</h2>
                <p>
                  Mars is a cold, desert world, with a thin atmosphere.
                  It looks red because of rusting iron and dust, which gets kicked up into the atmosphere.
                  The largest volcano in our solar system resides here, which is three times taller than the Mt Everest.

                <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                <p>
                  Jupiter is a gas giant and it‚Äôs the biggest planet in the solar system,
                  more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
                  Its famous red spot is a giant storm, which is bigger than earth itself and has raged for multiple decades.

                <h2>Saturn</h2>
                <p>
                  Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is famous for its stunning
                  ring system, which is made up of ice and rock particles.

                <h2>Uranus</h2>
                <p>
                  Uranus is an ice giant. It rotates at a nearly 90 degree angle, making it spin on its side and causing extreme seasons.
                  It has two sets of rings, but they‚Äôre not as complex as Saturns‚Äô.

                <h2>Neptune</h2>
                <p>
                  Just like Uranus, Neptune is an ice giant. It‚Äôs the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye.
                  Despite the cold, scientists think there‚Äôs an ocean of hot water underneath its cold clouds,
                  which stays inside due to extreme pressure.
